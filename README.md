# Education vs. salary

## Abstract

This project analyzes the relationship between education level and annual income across European countries using the Eurostat ilc_di08 dataset. I perform different statistics, data analysis, linear regression modeling, and hypothesis testing to evaluate how education influences income in different economic regions.

## Results

- Higher education levels are associated with significantly higher incomes across all countries
- The impact of education on income is more pronounced in economically poorer European countries
